            <h1>Initatives</h1>
            <p> 
                The Watelikers Organization has several 
                initiatives to represent its main movement. 
                These include newspaper-making, peaceful public
                 demonstrations, collaborations with local communities 
                 (e.g. waste collecting), and internet usage to spread
                  awareness of our issue and our movement battling 
                  against it. Do be aware that in the future, 
                  there will be more initiatives as our organization 
                  grows.
            </p>

            <p> Our organization has a wide range 
                of activities for our movement over

                Programs, Art and Awareness Campaigns,
